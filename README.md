## I was required to generate GUI for software that can do the following functions:  
  
1.	Global pairwise alignment  
2.	Local pairwise alignment  
3.	Multiple Sequence Alignment ïƒ  need to output text 
  
### GUI should take input sequence from the user through fasta file or text input. Then it should validate the inputs and execute the required alignment. Finally, it should represent the alignment itself along with the alignment score. using unique representations (plots) for your alignment result.  
  
### The GUI software, is needed to analyze and interpret the output of a set of sequences based on your group number. 
 
### Asses the produced MSA using three metrics; sum of pairs could be one of them.
