## I was required to generate GUI for software that can do the following functions:  
  
1.	Global pairwise alignment  
2.	Local pairwise alignment  
3.	Multiple Sequence Alignment ïƒ  need to output text 
  
### GUI should take input sequence from the user through fasta file or text input. Then it should validate the inputs and execute the required alignment. Finally, it should represent the alignment itself along with the alignment score. using unique representations (plots) for your alignment result.  
  
### The GUI software, is needed to analyze and interpret the output of a set of sequences based on your group number. 
 
### Asses the produced MSA using three metrics; sum of pairs could be one of them.


# Running the program

1. open the file after extracting it, using your vs code or similars.
2. download any needed libraries.
3. run the "Main_Integration.py" file.
4. you have 2 options even to add text then click "Ok" or "Cancel" if you want to remove that text OR upload a .fasta file. (to enter more than sequence split them with a single space)
5. you then can choose even if you want multiple or pairwise alignment.
6. if pairwise match, mismatch and gap scores will appear, so add them if not added they are defaulted with ones.
7. click on RUN at the top left to run the algorithm and wait for the image to appear and webpage to pop up, this webpage will make it easier to navigate all nucleotides in the sequences added.
8. you can then view the image in bigger size by clicking on "hide input" in the Display button at the top left corner.

Ps: the program will view an error msg if any problem happens (Error Handling).

## You can see this video for visual explanation.
